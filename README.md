Tommy Time is a **user-centered task management app** designed to provide a unified platform for creating, viewing, and managing tasks—something traditional calendar apps lacked. The user envisioned a **dark, gloomy skyscraper world** filled with **ambition and wealth**, and we worked hard to bring that atmosphere to life.
