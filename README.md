## Tommy Time App Overview

Tommy Time is a user-centered app designed to streamline task management. The user wanted a unified platform to create, view, and manage tasks—something other calendar apps couldn't quite provide. With a clear vision in mind, the user desired a unique theme—one that evokes the atmosphere of a dark, gloomy, skyscraper world filled with ambition and wealth. We worked hard to bring that vision to life.
